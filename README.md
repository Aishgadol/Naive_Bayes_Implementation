# Naive_Bayes_Implementation
This is a little project where I implemented a naive bayes classifier, as part of Introduction to Machine Learning course I'm taking in my studies..

Files train.txt , test.txt and readTrainData.py were supplied as data to work with and a uniform way of splitting the data in a way which allows to access and manipulate 
it with most ease.

We were instructed not to use Scikit for this, Scikit-Learn provides an implementation of Naive Bayes Classifiers, and this project's goal was to further deepen 
my understanding in this subject, and create an initial footstep in machine learning implementations.
